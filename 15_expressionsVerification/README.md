## Description

---

You're a math teacher at an elementary school. Today you taught your class basic arithmetic operations (<code>"+"</code>, <code>"-"</code>, <code>"\*"</code>, <code>"/"</code>) and now you need to give the students some homework. You have a lot of expressions in the format <code>a &lt;operation&gt; b = c</code>, where <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> are some integers and <code>operation</code> is one of the operations given above.

Information about these expressions is stored in the table **expressions**, which has the structure:

- **id**: the unique operation id;
- **a**: an integer;
- **b**: an integer;
- **operation**: one of the operations given above (<code>"+"</code>, <code>"-"</code>, <code>"\*"</code>, or <code>"/"</code>);
- **c**: an integer.

The homework you're going to give is simple: For each expression, the student needs to determine whether it's correct or not, i.e. whether it's true that the expression to the left of the <code>=</code> sign equals <code>c</code>.

Since you have many students and checking all their answers manually is a lot of work, you want to streamline the process by automatically identifying all the expressions that are correct. Given the table **expressions**, build the resulting table as follows: The table should have the same columns as the initial table does, but it should only contain those rows that represent correct expressions. The rows should be ordered by <code>id</code>.

**Example**

For the following table **expressions**

| id  | a   | b   | operation | c   |
| --- | --- | --- | --------- | --- |
| 1   | 2   | 3   | +         | 5   |
| 2   | 2   | 3   | +         | 6   |
| 3   | 3   | 2   | /         | 1   |
| 4   | 4   | 7   | \*        | 28  |
| 5   | 54  | 2   | -         | 27  |
| 6   | 3   | 0   | /         | 0   |

the output should be

| id  | a   | b   | operation | c   |
| --- | --- | --- | --------- | --- |
| 1   | 2   | 3   | +         | 5   |
| 4   | 4   | 7   | \*        | 28  |

Explanation:

- 2 + 3 = 5 - correct;
- 2 + 3 = 6 - incorrect;
- 3 / 2 = 1 - incorrect;
- 4 \* 7 = 28 - correct;
- 54 - 2 = 27 - incorrect;
- 3 / 0 = 0 - incorrect.
