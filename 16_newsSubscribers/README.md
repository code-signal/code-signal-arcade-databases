## Description

---

You are managing a small newspaper subscription service. Anyone who uses it can subscribe to a large number of different newspapers for a full year or just a half year.

The information about subscriptions is stored in the **full_year** and **half_year** tables, which have the following structures:

- **full_year**:
  - **id**: the unique subscription ID;
  - **newspaper**: the newspaper's name;
  - **subscriber**: the name of the subscriber.
- **half_year**:
  - **id**: the unique subscription ID;
  - **newspaper**: the newspaper's name;
  - **subscriber**: the name of the subscriber.

Given the **full_year** and **half_year** tables, compose the result as follows: The resulting table should have one column <code>subscriber</code> that contains all the distinct names of anyone who is subscribed to a newspaper with the word <code>Daily</code> in its name. The table should be sorted in ascending order by the subscribers' first names.

**Example**

The following tables **full_year**

| id  | newspaper          | subscriber    |
| --- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| 1   | The Paragon Herald | Crissy Sepe   |
| 2   | The Daily Reporter | Tonie Moreton |
| 3   | Morningtide Daily  | Erwin Chitty  |
| 4   | Daily Breakfast    | Tonie Moreton |
| 5   | Independent Weekly | Lavelle Phu   |

and **half_year**

| id  | newspaper             | subscriber    |
| --- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| 1   | The Daily Reporter    | Lavelle Phu   |
| 2   | Daily Breakfast       | Tonie Moreton |
| 3   | The Paragon Herald    | Lia Cover     |
| 4   | The Community Gazette | Lavelle Phu   |
| 5   | Nova Daily            | Lia Cover     |
| 6   | Nova Daily            | Joya Buss     |

the output should be

| subscriber    |
| ------------- |
| Erwin Chitty  |
| Joya Buss     |
| Lavelle Phu   |
| Lia Cover     |
| Tonie Moreton |
