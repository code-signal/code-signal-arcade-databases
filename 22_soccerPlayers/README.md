## Description

---

You have a table **soccer_team** that contains information about the players in your favorite soccer team. This table has the following structure:

- **id**: the unique ID of the player;
- **first_name**: the first name of the player;
- **surname**: the last name of the player;
- **player_number**: the number that the player wears (the number is guaranteed to be unique).

Create a semicolon-separated list of all the players, sorted by their numbers, and put this list in a table under a column called <code>players</code>. The information about each player should have the following format: <code>first_name surname #number</code>.

**Example**

For the following table **soccer_team**

| id  | first_name | surname  | player_number |
| --- | ---------- | -------- | ------------- |
| 1   | Alexis     | Sanchez  | 7             |
| 2   | Petr       | Cech     | 33            |
| 3   | Hector     | Bellerin | 24            |
| 4   | Olivier    | Giroud   | 12            |
| 5   | Theo       | Walcott  | 14            |
| 6   | Santi      | Cazorla  | 19            |

the output should be

| players                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alexis Sanchez #7; Oliver Giroud #12; Theo Walcott #14; Santi Cazorla #19; Hector Bellerin #24; Petr Cech #33 |
