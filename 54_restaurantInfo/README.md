## Description

---

You are managing a restaurant recommendation service that has recently started to gain popularity.

The information about the restaurants is currently stored in the **restaurants** table with the following structure:

- **id**: unique id of the restaurant;
- **name**: the restaurant's name.

As the table grew you decided to extend it, in particular add the <code>description</code> (<code>VARCHAR(100)</code>, the description of the restaurant) and <code>active</code> (<code>INT</code>, <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> if it works or closed respectively) columns.

Add these two new columns to the **restaurants** table using the following rules for all records:

- the <code>description</code> should be set to <code>"TBD"</code> (for To Be Defined).
- <code>active</code> should be set to <code>1</code>.

**Example**

For the following tables **restaurants**

| id  | name                     |
| --- | ------------------------ |
| id  | name                     |
| 1   | The Big City Barbecue    |
| 2   | Roadhouse                |
| 3   | Hibiscus                 |
| 4   | The Waterfront Courtyard |
| 5   | The Royal Spices         |

should become

| id  | name                     | description | active |
| --- | ------------------------ | ----------- | ------ |
| 1   | The Big City Barbecue    | TBD         | 1      |
| 2   | Roadhouse                | TBD         | 1      |
| 3   | Hibiscus                 | TBD         | 1      |
| 4   | The Waterfront Courtyard | TBD         | 1      |
| 5   | The Royal Spices         | TBD         | 1      |
